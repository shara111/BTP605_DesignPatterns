The term design patterns with respect to software applications was first coined in the classic "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". This book cataloged a set of design patterns found in various object-oriented applications. Since this book was written, other patterns have been cataloged and extended. Today's enterprise applications are large and complex. This course will dive into the architecture of large enterprise software, and patterns found in these software applications. Students studying this course will learn how modern applications are designed, allowing them to design, build and maintain large software applications.
